This is a possible alternative to Ant Design’s Cascader or TreeSelect. A live demo/proof-of-concept can be found here.

Sometimes the user needs to select nested data. Nested menus are quite common and work well pointing with a mouse. However, they don’t make for a good experience on touch or mobile devices. With this, users can go as deep into the tree as they want, and can stop at any level. They can go back one level quickly, or go to any level and start from there again. At all times, previous selections are clearly visible.

Works best with symmetrical data, you can provide an array that describes the hierarchy and the user gets a clear indication of which level they’re on.

Roadmap
Add support to override styles
Add iOS support
Add search for quickly adding single option as well as a whole chain of options
